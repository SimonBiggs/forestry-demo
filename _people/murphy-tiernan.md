My wife June and I both came to know Christ in 1972. Since then we  have shared a desire to serve the Lord - no matter where or how! Our time serving with the Institute of Evangelism in Papua New Guinea enabled us to grow and understand other cultures, which has been a blessing in our serving of the Lord and His people.
