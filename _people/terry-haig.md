My wife Maria and I have been worshipping at the Wagga Church of Christ since 1978 and grow even more passionate about serving the Lord with each year that passes. As the convenor of our Missions Finance and Support team, I have the role of calling in our members for the propagation of support for our mission teams in the field.
